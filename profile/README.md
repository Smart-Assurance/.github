## Introduction:
![Screenshot of Landing Page](landing_page_screenshot.png)
The automotive insurance sector is continuously evolving, constantly seeking ways to improve risk management and enhance process efficiency. In this context, our project aims to design and implement an intelligent, decentralized web application for automotive insurance using blockchain technology and a microservices architecture. This innovative approach seeks to fundamentally transform the way automotive insurance is managed by offering greater transparency, enhanced security, and increased agility.

## Web Application and Technologies Used:

### Angular:
Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.

### Spring Boot:
Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create microservices.

### MongoDB:
MongoDB is a NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

## DevOps:
We have chosen Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for our cloud infrastructure. Our DevOps setup includes Jenkins for continuous integration, Docker for containerization, Terraform for infrastructure as code, and Bash scripting for automation.

### 🛠️ Infrastructure Architecture:

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP):
Google Cloud Platform is a suite of cloud computing services provided by Google.

### Jenkins:
Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery of projects.

### Docker:
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

### Terraform:
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage cloud infrastructure.

### Bash Scripting:
Bash scripting is a scripting language used to automate tasks in a Linux environment.



## Blockchain:
For blockchain development, we utilize Ethereum, Solidity smart contracts, Hardhat for development environment, Etherscan for blockchain explorer, and MetaMask for wallet integration. One of the use cases of blockchain in our project is payment processing.

### 💸 Payment Use Case:
